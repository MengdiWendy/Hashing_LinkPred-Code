1. How to use? (demo)
	a. change the data direction in demo.R
	b. load the training, testing and feature data
	c. run the code and the code will print the AUC 

2. Demo Description
	a. Here we use a small network with 1178 nodes, the nodes are researchers and links are co-authorships between researchers. 
	b. Training network is the co-author network built based on historical data before 2011.
	c. Testing network is the network built based on data in 2011. (We will predict new links appear in 2011) 


3. Function Desription

3.1 W_train_P.R, W_train_nonbinary.R, W_train_P_semi.R are three functions for training linear projection W in different settings. W_train_P and W_train_nonbinary are for unsupervised learning with different H_bin and H_raw. W_train_P_semi.R is for semi-supervised setting dealing with H_bin. It also can be used in H_raw with a slightly  (see code commend).  

3.2 Lij_W_objective_P_nonbinary.R and Lij_W_objective_P are two functions to caculate objection function for H_raw and H_bin

3.3 R_W_P.R is to caculate the regularization term

3.4 Agg_H is to caculate the simialrity between two hashing tables using the method described in the paper
